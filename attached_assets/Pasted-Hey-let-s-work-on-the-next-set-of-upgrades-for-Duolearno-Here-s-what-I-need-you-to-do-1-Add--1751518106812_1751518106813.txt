Hey, let's work on the next set of upgrades for Duolearno.

Here’s what I need you to do:

✅ 1. Add LocalStorage for Progress Tracking

Track and store the user’s:

Total XP

Daily streak count

Last completed lesson ID

Last activity date

All data should persist across refreshes.

If the user leaves and returns the next day and completes a lesson, streak increases by 1.

If more than 24 hours have passed since the last activity, reset the streak to 0.

✅ 2. Build a Basic Daily Streak System

Add a simple visual streak tracker — something like:

“🔥 Streak: 3 days” at the top of the screen

Auto-update it based on LocalStorage data and activity timestamps

✅ 3. Add a Homepage with Course Cards

Create a /home or root route with 2–3 dummy course cards:

“Personal Finance 101”

“Design Basics”

“Mental Health 101”

Each card should include:

Course title

One-line description

“Start” button (only the first one needs to work)

Make it look like a real course selection screen, even if most links are placeholders for now

✅ 4. Detach UI From Duolingo's Look

Move away from Duolingo-style colors (avoid green, rounded bubbles, and same font)

Use a new theme — maybe teal, purple, or something playful but clean

Try a minimal, neumorphic or glassmorphic style if it’s easy to implement

Swap the font to something like Poppins or Inter using Google Fonts

✅ 5. Add Sound Effects

Add short SFX for:

Correct answer

Wrong answer

Earning XP

Use royalty-free .mp3 files stored locally (or link to CDN if easier)

Include a mute/unmute toggle somewhere (top-right corner or settings icon)

✅ 6. Light UI Polish

Add a floating XP counter and streak tracker on every screen

Maybe add a small avatar/profile icon (even static is fine) with tooltip showing:

“XP: 130 | Streak: 2 days”

✅ 7. Add Multi-Tab Navigation to the App

Introduce a tabbed navigation system with at least three main tabs:

Home — A welcome page briefly explaining what the app is about and how to get started

Courses — The page with available course cards and lessons

Profile — A dashboard showing the user’s:

Ongoing courses

Total XP

Progress bar(s)

Streak info

Ensure the tab bar is always visible and mobile-friendly. Keep the navigation intuitive and light-weight.
